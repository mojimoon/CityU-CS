## Week 2

1. Advantages of 5G:

- Higher data rates
- Lower latency
- Increased capacity (more devices)
- Enhanced connectivity for IoT devices

2. Applications of 5G technologies:

- eMBB (enhanced Mobile Broadband): 4K video streaming
- mMTC (massive Machine Type Communications): Smart cities with connected sensors
- URLLC (Ultra-Reliable Low Latency Communications): Remote surgery

3. Example of IoT device:

Smart thermostat that adjusts home temperature based on user preferences and weather conditions, and can be controlled remotely via a smartphone app.

4. Challenges of IoT concerning data:

- How to organize, communicate, and analyze the massive amount of data generated by IoT devices.
- Ensuring data privacy and security.
- How to choose suitable transmission protocols and network technologies for different IoT applications.

5. Cloud computing vs Edge computing on maintaining:

Cloud computing is easier to maintain as the cloud service provider handles updates, security, and infrastructure management. Edge computing requires more maintenance at the local level, as devices need to be managed and updated individually.

6. Cloud computing vs Edge computing on latency:

Edge computing has lower latency since data is processed closer to the source, reducing the time it takes for data to travel to a central server and back. Cloud computing may experience higher latency due to the distance data must travel to reach the cloud server.
