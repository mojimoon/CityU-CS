## Week 1: Importance of IS

### Terms

- IS (Information System): A computer-based system that stores, organizes, and provide access to information.
- MIS (Management Information System): **Use IS, manage IS and achieve strategies**.
- 5 components of IS: **Hardware, Software, Data, Procedures, People**.

## Week 3: Organizational Strategy

### Porter's Five Forces

- 3 competitive forces
    - **Degree of rivalry**: existing competitors
    - **Threat of new entrants**: new competitors
    - **Threat of substitutes**: similar products or services
- 2 bargaining power forces
    - **Bargaining power of suppliers**: suppliers can drive up prices
        - supplier-buyer ratio (no of suppliers / no of buyers). A low ratio means the buyer has less alternatives, and thus suppliers have more power
        - dependence
        - switching costs
        - substitute availability
    - **Bargaining power of customers**: customers can drive down prices
        - purchase volume share (amt of purchases from a single supplier / total purchases). A high share means the customer is more dependent on the supplier, and thus customers have less power
        - product differentiation
        - switching costs
        - substitute availability

### Competitive Strategies

- **Industry-wide cost**: lowest cost across the industry
- **Industry-wide differentiation**: unique product/service across the industry
