    - There are many suppliers providing the same raw materials for comparable prices.

Answer: B

Consider the company A is trying to buy raw materials from a supplier B.

- If the competitors of A have decreased demand for raw materials, then more raw materials will be available for A to buy, which means A can choose a cheaper supplier. So the bargaining power of B is weak.
- If the availability of raw materials is limited, then A has no choice but to buy from B, so the bargaining power of B is strong.
- If the supplier B has excess inventory, he wants to get rid of it, so he will be willing to sell it at a lower price, so the bargaining power of B is weak.
- If there are many suppliers providing the same raw materials for comparable prices, then A can easily switch to another supplier with little cost, so the bargaining power of B is weak.
