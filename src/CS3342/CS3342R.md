# CS3342 Concepts Review

## Software and Software Engineering

A **Software** is a set of instructions that tell a computer what to do. It is a collection of programs, documents and data structures.

What defines a quality software:

- Follows **requirements specification** (It works as expected)
- Readable and maintainable
- Modifyable (extensible)
- Completed within time and budget

**Software Engineering** is the proess of solving users' problems by the systematic development and evolution of large software systems.

Software engineering **models** a system, while software programming **implements** the system. (e.g. class diagram vs. actual code)

## Object-Oriented Programming

An **Object** is an entity that has state and operations on that state (methods). An **Object Class** is a template for creating objects.

In actual coding, a **Class** is a set of related objects. An **Object** is an instance of a class.

Advantages of OOP:

- Maintainability
- Resuability

**State** of an object: the values of the object's attributes.

Two logical types of methods: **operations** (change fields) and **queries** (return information).

**Message Passing**: Objects communicate by sending messages to each other. `object.method()`

### Inheritance / Generalization

If X **inherits** from Y, X is a **subclass** of Y, and Y is a **superclass** of X.

In class diagram, this is represented by Y **generalizes** X. A solid line with a triangle pointing to Y.

**is-a** relationship: if X inherits from Y, X is a Y.

X inherits ALL attributes, operations and relationships from Y.

X may have additional and overridden attributes and operations.

Advantages of inheritance:

- An abstraction mechanism to classify objects
- Reusability
- Support for polymorphism
- Provide organizational knowledge about domains and systems

Drawbacks of inheritance:

- Classes are not self-contained (X is dependent on Y)
- Inheritance graph needs to be separately maintained

### Encapsulation / Information Hiding

**Encapsulation** is the bundling of data and the methods that operate on that data into a single unit.

**Information Hiding** is the principle of hiding the implementation details (attributes) of an object from the outside world.

Advantages of information hiding:

- Protects the object's integrity
- Communication between objects is simplified
- Classes are not dependent on each other (i.e. changing a object's implementation does not affect other objects, as long as the method signature is the same)

### Abstraction

Abstraction is the process of removing details and generalizing concepts.

**Abstract class**

- A special class that cannot be instantiated, i.e. with `new`
- Can have default implementations, and subclasses can override them
- **No multiple inheritance**

**Interface**

- A collection of abstract methods
- No method implementation, and subclasses must implement them (unless subclass is abstract. interface cannot implement another interface)
- **Support multiple inheritance**

In class diagram,

- X inherits from abstract class Y: same as inheritance
- X implements interface Y: a dashed line with a triangle pointing to Y
- X uses Y: a dashed line with an arrow pointing to Y

### Polymorphism

**Polymorphism** allows a subclass to provide a specific implementation of a method that is already provided by its superclass.

Implemented by method overriding.

## Software Development Process

A **software process** is a concrete definition of the steps and activities involved in developing a software product, within a certain time frame and budget.

A **software process model** is an abstract representation of a process.

All models consists of different **Phases**. Each phase has 3 components:

- set of **activities**
- set of **deliverables**
- **quality control** measures

### Waterfall Model

5 stages:

- Requirements definition
- System and software design
- Implementation and unit testing
- Integration and system testing
- Operation and maintenance

The system may go back to previous stages if necessary.

- Advantages:
    - Easy
    - Structured
    - Provide a template into which methods for analysis, design, coding, testing, and maintenance can be placed (i.e. each phase has a clear and separate goal)
- Disadvantages:
    - Sequential, does not reflect reality
    - No prototype is delivered
        - Testing and feedback only happens at the end
        - Rely on accurate requirement specification
    - Takes a long time to deliver

**Pure waterfall model**: No overlap between phases

- Each phase must be completed before the next phase begins
- Once a phase is completed, it is not revisited

When to use:

- Simple project
- Limited resources
- Well-understood requirements and technology

### Incremental Model

Goal: deliver a working product quickly

- 1st increment: core product
- each subsequent increment adds more features

When to use:

- Requirements are well understood
- System can be partitioned into increments

RAD (Rapid Application Development) is a type of incremental model.

RAD breaks down the project into smaller modules, and each module is developed and tested separately by different teams.

### Evolutionary Models

Specification, development and validation are concurrent; **rapid feedback** is given to all of them

- Advantage:
    - Do not require full knowledge of requirements at the beginning
    - Iterative
    - Allows feedback
- Disadvantage:
    - Hard to manage
    - Hard to estimate time and cost

When to use:

- Core requirements are well understood
- Additional requirements are evolving and changing fast

3 types:

(1) **Prototyping Model**

- Start with the most prominent requirements (usually a visual prototype)
- Show to users, help refine requirements
- Better communication between users and developers

Advantages: easier to identify requirements

Disadvantages: customers may take the quality of the prototype as the quality of the final product (performance, reliability, etc.)

When to use:

- When the customer only defines general objectives, but not detailed requirements
- When the developer is unsure about UX design

(2) **Spiral Model**

Iterative model that emphasizes risk analysis

Consists of several loops, each is a mini-waterfall model

The phases in each loop is not fixed, but usually:

- Evaluate risks + prototype
- Develop + test
- Plan next iteration
- Determine objectives, alternatives, and constraints

Advantages: risk management (early warning); can be combined with other models

Disadvantages: complex, hard to manage

When to use: 

- Very large projects
- When technical skills must be evaluated at each step (to mitigate risks)

(3) **Concurrent Engineering Model**

**Divide and conquer**: divide the project into smaller parts, and develop them parallelly

Each team follows a spiral model

### Other Models

(1) **Component-based Software Engineering** (CBSE)

Reuse existing components to build new software

- **Commercial off-the-shelf (COTS)**: buy components
- In-house components
- Interface compatibility is crucial

CBSE design principles:

- Components are **independent**
- Component implementation is **hidden**
- Well-defined **interfaces**
- Components share the same **platform** and reduce development efforts/costs

Components should be standardised, independent, composable, deployable, and documented.

## Roles of Variables

| Variable Type | Definition | Remarks |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Constant | fixed value | method parameters should be treated as constants (i.e. not modified) |
| Stepper | loop counter | |
| Most-Recent Holder | last value encountered | by input or loop |
| Gatherer | sum or count | |
| Transformation | value calculated from other variables | max, min is also a transformation variable |
| One-way Flag | boolean | |
| Temporary | short-lived | |
| Organizer | data container | |

Design principles: one variable, one role

## Use Case Diagram & Use Case Specification

Requirement Elicitation & Analysis

Elements of a use case diagram:

- System Boundary
- Actors
- Use Cases
- Relationships

**Actors** are external entities that input data or receive output from the system. e.g. databases or printers are not actors.

Types of relationships:

- **Association**: if actor A is associated with use case B, A uses B (solid line)
- **Include**: use case A includes use case B (dashed line, arrow pointing to B)
- **Extend**: use case A conditionally includes use case B, or B extends A (dashed line, arrow pointing to A)
- **Generalization**: use case A1, A2, ... inherits from use case A, or A generalizes A1, A2, ... (solid line, triangle pointing to A)

**Use Case Specification** is a detailed description of a use case.

Elements of a use case specification:

- Use Case Name
- Actors
- Description
- Reference (ID)
- Typical Course of Events
    - Actor Action
    - System Response
- Alternative Course of Events (including exceptions)
- Precondition
- Postcondition

**Post-condition**: the state of the system after the use case is completed
- **Minimal Guarantee**: the minimum guarantee that the system will provide upon completion (regardless of exceptions)
- **Success Guarantee**: the guarantee that the system will provide if the use case is completed successfully

## Sequence Diagram

Elements of a sequence diagram:

- **Lifeline**: vertical dashed line representing an object
- **Message**: horizontal arrow representing a method call
- **Activation**: vertical dashed line representing the time the object is active
- Objects (including actors)

Types of messages:

- Synchronous: caller suspended until callee returns
- Asynchronous: caller continues execution after sending message
- Return (dotted line)
- Object creation (dotted line): point to the object's name box
- Self-call (self loop)
- Destruction

- **Lost Message**: message to external object
- **Found Message**: message from external object
- InteractionUse (Ref): reference to another sequence diagram
- CombinedFragments: flow control
    - alt: similar to switch-case
        - at most one operand is executed
        - can have multiple branches
        - `else` is optional
    - opt: similar to if
        - no else
    - break
        - if the condition is true, the `break` fragment is executed, and the rest is skipped
        - if the condition is false, the `break` fragment is skipped, and the rest is executed
    - loop
        - loop with a condition or certain number of iterations `(min, max)`
    
## Class Diagram

- Association
    - Composition: A has-a B (enforced), black diamond pointing to A
    - Aggregation: A has-a B (optional), white diamond pointing to A
    - Association: A uses B, solid line
- Association and Multiplicity (Cardinality)
    - 1: exactly one
    - 0..1: zero or one
    - 0..* or *: any number
    - 1..*: one or more

## Design Principles

### SOLID Principles

- **Single Responsibility Principle** (SRP)
- **Open/Closed Principle** (OCP)
- **Liskov Substitution Principle** (LSP)
- **Interface Segregation Principle** (ISP)
- **Dependency Inversion Principle** (DIP)

Additionally, **Law of Demeter** (LoD)

### OCP and DIP

OCP: software entities should be **open for extension, but closed for modification**

- new functionality should be added by adding new code, not by changing existing code
- object variables should be **private**
- use state/strategy pattern and polymorphism

DIP: high-level modules should not depend on low-level modules, but both should depend on abstractions

i.e. high-level modules use interfaces that are implemented by low-level modules

Goal: prevent direct dependencies between modules, reduce coupling

### LSP

Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types

e.g. We cannot substitute a square for a rectangle, because a square has additional constraints

Issue: if you use a `Rectangle` or use a `Square`, everything goes well. But if you use a `Square` as a `Rectangle`, it may not work as expected.

`Rectangle s = new Square();` will invoke the method `setHeight` and `setWidth` in `Square`, but not in `Rectangle`.

### SRP

A class has only one reason to change (i.e. only one responsibility)

### ISP

A class should not be forced to implement interfaces it does not use

e.g. a `Door` can `lock` and `unlock`, and an `AlarmDoor` adds `alarm` functionality

Implementation 1: (multiple inheritance)

```java
interface IDoor { void lock(); void unlock(); }
interface IAlarm { void alarm(); }
class Door implements IDoor { void lock() { ... } void unlock() { ... } }
class AlarmDoor implements IDoor, IAlarm { void lock() { ... } void unlock() { ... } void alarm() { ... } }
```

Implementation 2: (nested inheritance)

```java
interface IDoor { void lock(); void unlock(); }
interface IAlarm { void alarm(); }
class Door implements IDoor { void lock() { ... } void unlock() { ... } }
class AlarmDoor extends Door implements IAlarm { void alarm() { ... } }
```

Implementation 3: (delegation)

```java
interface IDoor { void lock(); void unlock(); }
interface IAlarm { void alarm(); }
class Door implements IDoor { void lock() { ... } void unlock() { ... } }
class AlarmDoor implements IAlarm { private Door door; void lock() { door.lock(); } void unlock() { door.unlock(); } void alarm() { ... } }
```

### LoD

A class should only talk to its immediate friends (if A uses B, B uses C, then A should not access C, instead delegate to B)

### Cohesion and Coupling

**Cohesion**: the degree to which the elements inside a module belong together

**Coupling**: the degree of interdependence between modules

Goal: high cohesion, low coupling

Degree of coupling:

- Data coupling: modules share data (primitive types or whole custom objects)
- Stamp coupling: modules share a complex data structure (but not all fields are used)
- Control coupling: modules share control information (e.g. a flag in A controls the behavior of B)
- Common coupling: modules share global data (e.g. a global variable)
- Content coupling: modules share internal working mechanism (e.g. code copy-paste)

Degree of cohesion:

- Functional cohesion: elements perform a single task
- Chain cohesion: output of one element is the input of another (chain execution)
- Communicational cohesion: elements operate on the same data (graph traversal)

Low coupling: OCP / DIP / LoD (encourages inheritance and delegation to prevent unnecessary dependencies)

High cohesion: ISP / SRP / LSP (encourages division of responsibilities)

## Design Patterns

### Creational Patterns: Singleton

Ensure a class has only one instance, and provide a global point of access to it

```java
public class Singleton {
    private static Singleton instance; // static variable
    private Singleton() {} // private constructor
    public static Singleton getInstance() { if (instance == null) instance = new Singleton(); return instance; }
}
```

In a class diagram, a singleton is represented by a self-loop on the class.

### Creational Patterns: Factory Method

Define an interface for creating an object, but let subclasses decide which class to instantiate

consists of 4 components:

- abstract product: the interface of the product
- concrete product: the implementation of the product
- abstract factory: the interface for creating and using the product
- concrete factory: the implementation of the factory (actually creates the product)

```java
public interface Shape { void draw(); } // abstract product
public class Circle implements Shape { public void draw() { ... } } // concrete product
public class Rectangle implements Shape { public void draw() { ... } } // concrete product
public abstract class AbstractFactory { 
    protected abstract Shape getShape(String shapeType);
    public void userDraw(String shapeType) { Shape s = getShape(shapeType); if (s != null) s.draw(); }
} // abstract factory
public class ShapeFactory extends AbstractFactory {
    protected Shape getShape(String shapeType) {
        if (shapeType.equals("CIRCLE")) return new Circle();
        else if (shapeType.equals("RECTANGLE")) return new Rectangle();
        return null;
    }
} // concrete factory
```

### Structural Patterns: Facade

A simplified library (Facade Frontend) that provides interfaces of a complex system (Backend) to external users (Client)

### Behavioral Patterns: State/Strategy

State: allow an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes

Strategy: define a family of algorithms, encapsulate each one, and make them interchangeable (State pattern with only 1 method)

Advantages:

- Consolidate: put all behavior-related code in one place as one object
- Consistent and allow state changes

Disadvantages:

- Many objects are created (singleton can be used to reduce the number of instances, if the state instance is not object-specific)

### Behavioral Patterns: Observer

Define a one-to-many dependency between objects, so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically

```java
abstract class Subject { // abstract message sender
    private List<Observer> observers = new ArrayList<>();
    public void attach(Observer o) { observers.add(o); }
    public void detach(Observer o) { observers.remove(o); }
    public void notifyObservers() { for (Observer o : observers) o.update(); } // inform all observers to update their state
}
class RSSFeed extends Subject { // concrete message sender
    private String latestNews;
    public void setNews(String news) { latestNews = news; notifyObservers(); } // upon original object state change, notify all observers
    public String getNews() { return latestNews; }
}
abstract class Observer { // abstract message receiver
    protected String news;
    public abstract void update();
}
class MobileRSSReader extends Observer { // concrete message receiver
    private Subject subject;
    public MobileRSSReader(Subject s) { subject = s; subject.attach(this); }
    public void update() { news = subject.getNews(); }
}
```

Supports broadcast communication

### Behavioral Patterns: Command

Encapsulate a request as an object, thereby allowing for parameterization of clients with different requests, queuing requests, and logging requests

```java
public interface Command { void execute(String[] args); void undo(); void redo(); }
public class CmdInsert implements Command { ... }
public class CmdUpdate implements Command { ... }
public class CmdDelete implements Command { ... }
public class Invoker {
    private Invoker() {}
    private Invoker instance;
    public Invoker getInstance() { if (instance == null) instance = new Invoker(); return instance; }

    private ArrayList<Command> undoStack = new ArrayList<>();
    private ArrayList<Command> redoStack = new ArrayList<>();
    public void execute(Command c, String[] args) { c.execute(args); undoStack.add(c); redoStack.clear(); }
    public void undo() { Command c = undoStack.remove(undoStack.size() - 1); c.undo(); redoStack.add(c); }
    public void redo() { Command c = redoStack.remove(redoStack.size() - 1); c.redo(); undoStack.add(c); }
}
```
