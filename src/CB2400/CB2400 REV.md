# CB2400 Microeconomics - Review

## 1. Fundamental Economic Issues

- **Economics**: the study of how individuals, firms, and societies choose to allocate scarce resources to satisfy their unlimited wants.
- **Microeconomics**: the study of how households (consumers) and firms (producers) make decisions and how they interact in markets.
- **Macroeconomics**: the study of the economy as a whole, including topics such as inflation, unemployment, and economic growth.

Scarcity and Choice

- **Scarcity**: the quantity of resources is insufficient to satisfy all human wants.
- **Opportunity cost**: the value of the next best alternative that must be forgone as a result of a decision.
- **Sunk cost**: a cost that has already been incurred and cannot be recovered.

### Production Possibility Curve (PPC)

- X-axis = K = Capital goods
- Y-axis = C = Consumer goods
- PPC depicts all maximum combinations of two goods that can be produced with given resources and technology.
- Slope $|k| = \frac{\Delta C}{\Delta K}$ = units of C that must be given up to produce one more unit of K = opportunity cost of producing one more unit of K.

Shifts in PPC:

- Techonology progress
- Input increase

### Economic Systems

- **Economic system**: the way in which a society organizes the production, distribution, and consumption of goods and services.
    - **what** goods and services are produced
    - **how** to combine inputs to produce outputs
    - **for whom** to produce
- **Market economy**: an economy in which decisions about production and consumption are made by individual producers and consumers.
- **Command economy**: an economy in which decisions about production and consumption are made by Central Planning Authority.

## 2. Demand and Supply

### Demand

**Demand**: the maximum quantity of a good that consumers are willing and able to purchase at various prices.

**Demand function**: $Q_d = f(P, Y_2, Y_3, ...)$

**Demand curve**: $Q_d = f(P)$ the relationship between quantity demanded and price.

**Law of demand**: If the price of a good rises, the quantity demanded of that good falls, and vice versa. Demand curve is **downward sloping**.

**Demand determinants**:

- Price of related goods
    - When substitute Y's price rises, demand for X increases.
    - When complement Y's price rises, demand for X decreases.
- Income
    - For a normal good, demand increases as income increases.
    - For an inferior good, demand decreases as income increases.
- Expectation of future prices
    - If consumers expect prices to rise in the future, demand increases today.

**Market demand**: **horizontal summation** of individual demand curves.

$Q_d = Q_{d1} + Q_{d2} + ...$ at fixed price.

- **Demand function**: 3D graph, $(P_X, Y)$ plane and $Q_d$ axis.
- **Demand curve**: 2D graph, $P_X$ on X-axis and $Q_d$ on Y-axis.
- **Movement along the demand curve**: **change in quantity demanded** due to change in price $P_X$.
- **Shift in the demand curve**: **change in demand** due to change in non-price determinants $Y$.

### Supply

**Supply**: the maximum quantity of a good that producers are willing and able to offer at various prices.

**Supply function**: $Q_s = f(P, \overline{Y_2}, \overline{Y_3}, ...)$

**Supply curve**: $Q_s = f(P)$ the relationship between quantity supplied and price.

**Law of supply**: If the price of a good rises, the quantity supplied of that good rises, and vice versa. Supply curve is **upward sloping**.

**Supply determinants**:

- Price of inputs
    - When input price rises, supply decreases.
- Technology
    - When technology improves, supply increases.
- Expectation of future prices
    - If producers expect prices to rise in the future, supply decreases today.

**Market supply**: **horizontal summation** of individual supply curves.

### Market Equilibrium

**Market equilibrium**: the point at which the quantity demanded equals the quantity supplied.

- If $P > P^*, Q_s > Q_d$, surplus.
- If $P < P^*, Q_s < Q_d$, shortage.
- If price ceiling is below equilibrium price, shortage.
- If price floor is above equilibrium price, surplus.

## 3. Elasticity

### Elasticity of Demand

#### Price Elasticity of Demand

$\varepsilon_{P_X} = \frac{\Delta Q^d / Q^d}{\Delta P_X / P_X}$

$\varepsilon_{P_X} < 0$ based on law of demand.

- $\varepsilon_{P_X} > 1$: elastic
- $\varepsilon_{P_X} = 1$: unitary elastic
- $\varepsilon_{P_X} < 1$: inelastic
- If demand is elastic, $P \uparrow \Rightarrow TR \downarrow$.
- If demand is inelastic, $P \uparrow \Rightarrow TR \uparrow$.

Determinants of price elasticity of demand:

- Necessary vs. luxury goods
    - Necessary (inelastic)
    - Luxury (elastic)
- Availability of substitutes
    - More substitutes (elastic)
    - Few substitutes (inelastic)
- Proportion of income spent on the good
    - Large proportion (elastic)
    - Small proportion (inelastic)

**Perfectly elastic demand**: $\varepsilon_{P_X} = -\infty$

- Demand curve is horizontal.
- Win all customers by lowering price, lose all customers by raising price.

**Perfectly inelastic demand**: $\varepsilon_{P_X} = 0$

- Demand curve is vertical.
- Quantity demanded is fixed regardless of price.

#### Income Elasticity of Demand

$\varepsilon_Y = \frac{\Delta Q^d / Q^d}{\Delta Y / Y}$

- $\varepsilon_Y > 1$: luxury good (elastic)
- $0 < \varepsilon_Y < 1$: necessity (inelastic)
- $\varepsilon_Y < 0$: inferior good

#### Cross-Price Elasticity of Demand

$\varepsilon_{Q^d_X, P_Y} = \frac{\Delta Q^d_X / Q^d_X}{\Delta P_Y / P_Y}$

- $\varepsilon_{Q^d_X, P_Y} > 0$: substitutes
- $\varepsilon_{Q^d_X, P_Y} < 0$: complements

### Elasticity of Supply

$\varepsilon_{P_X} = \frac{\Delta Q^s / Q^s}{\Delta P_X / P_X}$

$\varepsilon_{P_X} > 0$ based on law of supply.

- $\varepsilon_{P_X} > 1$: elastic
- $\varepsilon_{P_X} = 1$: unitary elastic
- $\varepsilon_{P_X} < 1$: inelastic

### Midpoint Method

The above formula uses the initial point as the denominator, which may lead to different results when the price is rising or falling.

$\varepsilon_{\alpha} = \frac{\Delta Q / Q}{\Delta \alpha / \alpha} = \frac{Q_2 - Q_1}{Q_1} \div \frac{\alpha_2 - \alpha_1}{\alpha_1}$

Midpoint method:

$\varepsilon_{\alpha} = \frac{Q_2 - Q_1}{(Q_2 + Q_1) / 2} \div \frac{\alpha_2 - \alpha_1}{(\alpha_2 + \alpha_1) / 2}$

## 4. Consumer Theory

### Utility

Assumptions:

- **Completeness**: consumers can rank all possible baskets
- **transitivity**: if A is preferred to B and B is preferred to C, then A is preferred to C
- **Non-satiation**: more is preferred to less

**Utility**: a numerical representation of the satisfaction or happiness that a consumer receives from consuming a good or service.

**Utility function**: $U = f(X_1, X_2, ...)$

### Indifference Curves

Indifference curve $U = f(X_1, X_2)$: a curve that shows all combinations of two goods that provide the consumer with the same level of satisfaction.

Properties:

- Higher IC is preferred to lower IC (non-satiation)
- IC is downward sloping (opportunity cost)
- IC is convex to the origin (diminishing MRS)
- IC does not intersect (transitivity)
- There is one IC for every combination (completeness)

**Marginal rate of substitution (MRS)**: the rate at which a consumer is willing to trade one good for another.

$MRS_{X_1} = \frac{\Delta X_2}{\Delta X_1} = \frac{MU_{X_1}}{MU_{X_2}}$

### Budget Constraint and Consumer Equilibrium

**Budget constraint**: $P_1X_1 + P_2X_2 = I$

- Intersects X-axis at $X_1 = I / P_1$, Y-axis at $X_2 = I / P_2$
- Slope = $-P_1 / P_2$

**Consumer equilibrium**: the point at which the highest attainable IC is tangent to the budget constraint.

- When $MRS_{X_1} = \frac{P_1}{P_2} \Rightarrow \frac{MU_{X_1}}{P_1} = \frac{MU_{X_2}}{P_2}$, consumer is maximizing utility.
- When $MRS_{X_1} > \frac{P_1}{P_2} \Rightarrow \frac{MU_{X_1}}{P_1} > \frac{MU_{X_2}}{P_2}$, consumer should consume more of $X_1$.
- When $MRS_{X_1} < \frac{P_1}{P_2} \Rightarrow \frac{MU_{X_1}}{P_1} < \frac{MU_{X_2}}{P_2}$, consumer should consume more of $X_2$.

### Diminishing Marginal Utility

**Marginal utility** $MU = \frac{\Delta U}{\Delta X}$

**Diminishing marginal utility**: as a consumer consumes more of a good, the additional satisfaction from each additional unit of the good decreases.

## 5. Production and Costs

### Production Function

**Production function**: $Q = f(L, K)$

- **Short run**: at least one input is fixed.
- **Long run**: all inputs are variable.

### Isoquant Curve

$Q = f(L, K)$: a curve that shows all combinations of two inputs that produce the same level of output.

**Marginal rate of technical substitution (MRTS)**: the rate at which a firm is willing to substitute one input for another while keeping output constant.

$MRTS = \frac{\Delta K}{\Delta L} = \frac{MP_L}{MP_K}$

### Isocost Line

$C = wL + rK$: a line that shows all combinations of two inputs that cost the same amount.

- Intersects X-axis at $L = C / w$, Y-axis at $K = C / r$
- Slope = $-w / r$

### Producer Equilibrium

**Producer equilibrium**: the point at which the highest attainable isoquant is tangent to the isocost line.

- When $MRTS = \frac{w}{r} \Rightarrow \frac{MP_L}{w} = \frac{MP_K}{r}$, producer is minimizing cost.
- When $MRTS > \frac{w}{r} \Rightarrow \frac{MP_L}{w} > \frac{MP_K}{r}$, producer should use more of $L$.
- When $MRTS < \frac{w}{r} \Rightarrow \frac{MP_L}{w} < \frac{MP_K}{r}$, producer should use more of $K$.

### Law of Diminishing Returns

$TP = f(L), MP = \frac{\Delta TP}{\Delta L}, AP = \frac{TP}{L}$

**Law of diminishing returns**: as a firm uses more of a variable input with a fixed input, the marginal product of the variable input will eventually decrease.

Relationship between MP and AP:

- When MP > AP, AP is increasing.
- When MP = AP, AP is constant.
- When MP < AP, AP is decreasing.
- MP starts to decrease before AP.

## 6. Cost Theory

### Types of Costs

Short-run costs:

| Type | Formula | Shape |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Total cost | $TC = TFC + TVC$ | Increasing |
| Total fixed cost | $TFC$ | Constant |
| Total variable cost | $TVC$ | Increasing |
| Average total cost | $ATC = \frac{TC}{Q}$ | U-shaped |
| Average fixed cost | $AFC = \frac{TFC}{Q}$ | Decreasing |
| Average variable cost | $AVC = \frac{TVC}{Q}$ | U-shaped |
| Marginal cost | $MC = \frac{\Delta TC}{\Delta Q}$ | U-shaped |

Long run costs:

| Type | Formula | Shape |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Long-run total cost | $LRTC$ | Increasing |
| Long-run average cost | $LRAC = \frac{LRTC}{Q}$ | U-shaped |
| Long-run marginal cost | $LRMC = \frac{\Delta LRTC}{\Delta Q}$ | U-shaped |

### Long-Run Costs

Suppose a firm increases all inputs by $x$ times:

- If output increases by more than $x$ times, **increasing returns to scale**.
- If output increases by exactly $x$ times, **constant returns to scale**.
- If output increases by less than $x$ times, **decreasing returns to scale**.

Relationship between LRAC and LRMC:

- LRAC, LRMC is U-shaped, decreases first and then increases.
- LRMC intersects LRAC at the minimum point of LRAC.

### Connection between Short-Run and Long-Run Costs

LRAC is the envelope of all SRATC curves.

- It connects the lowest points of each SRATC curve.
- SRATC curve is tangent to LRAC curve at the minimum point.
    - If LRAC increases as $Q$ increases, **economies of scale**
    - If LRAC remains constant as $Q$ increases, **constant economies of scale**
    - If LRAC decreases as $Q$ increases, **diseconomies of scale**

LRTC is the envelope of all SRATC curves.

- It connects the lowest points of each SRATC curve.
- When $Q$ increases, SRATC shifts up and right
    - UP: TFC increases as $K$ increases
    - RIGHT: output increases as $K$ increases

## 7. Perfect Competition

| Characteristic | Perfect competition | Monopoly | Monopolistic competition | Oligopoly |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Sellers | Many | One | Many | Few |
| Entry and exit | Free | Blocked | Free | Blocked |
| Goods | Identical | Unique | Differentiated | Identical or differentiated |
| Information | Perfect | Imperfect | Imperfect | Imperfect |

### Three types of demand curves

- Individual demand curve: downward sloping
    - the price-quantity relationship for an individual consumer
- Market demand curve: downward sloping
    - horizontal summation of individual demand curves
- Demand curve **facing a perfectly competitive firm**: horizontal
    - demand is perfectly inelastic; in a perfectly competitive market, the firm is a price taker

### Profit Maximization

- Total Revenue: $TR = P \times Q$
- Marginal Revenue: $MR = \frac{\Delta TR}{\Delta Q}$
- Total Profit: $\pi = TR - TC = (P - ATC) \times Q$
- Profit Maximization: $MR = MC$

### Normal and Economic Profit

- **Accounting profit**: total revenue minus total explicit costs. $AP = TR - TC$
- **Normal profit**: the minimum profit necessary to keep a firm in operation.
    - Opportunity cost of the resources used by the firm.
- **Economic profit**: total revenue minus total cost, including both explicit (wages, interest, rent) and implicit (opportunity cost) costs.
    - Accounting profit minus opportunity cost.

Profit Breakdown:

- When $MR \geq MC$, $TR \geq TFC + TVC$
    - The company is making economic profit.
- When $TVC < TR < TFC + TVC$
    - The company is making negative economic profit but positive accounting profit.
- When $TR < TVC$
    - The company is making negative economic profit and negative accounting profit.

**Shutdown point**: When $TR < TVC$, the firm should shut down.

**Expansion point**: When $TR > TFC + TVC$, the firm should expand. This increases $\pi$, but the normal profit remains the same.

**Long-run equilibrium**: The company makes zero economic profit in the long run. New firms enter the market when economic profit is positive, and existing firms exit the market when economic profit is negative.

## 8. Allocative Efficiency

### Surplus

- **Consumer surplus** (CS): the difference between what consumers are willing to pay for a good and what they actually pay.
    - Area under the demand curve and above the price.
    - **net benefit** of consuming a good.
    - $P = MB$ = marginal benefit of consuming one more unit = maximum price a consumer is willing to pay.
- **Producer surplus** (PS): the difference between what producers are willing to accept for a good and what they actually receive.
    - Area above the supply curve and below the price.
    - $P = MC$ = marginal cost of producing one more unit = minimum price a producer is willing to accept.

### Allocative Efficiency

**Allocative efficiency**: the allocation of resources that maximizes total surplus. achieved when the value that consumers place on a good (marginal benefit) equals the cost of the resources used to produce the good (marginal cost).

- When $MB = MC$, allocative efficiency is achieved.
- If $Q < Q^*$, $MB > MC$, producers will expand production.
- If $Q > Q^*$, $MB < MC$, producers will reduce production.

**Society's welfare** = $CS + PS$

**Market failure**: when the market fails to allocate resources efficiently.

**Deadweight social loss**: the loss of society's welfare due to market failure.

DWL = theoretical welfare - actual welfare

## 9. Monopoly

Barries to entry:

- **Legal barriers**: government grants exclusive rights to a firm.
- **Input/resource ownership barriers**: a firm owns a key resource.
- **Cost barriers**: the monopoly has cost advantages over potential competitors.
    - Economies of scale: the monopoly can supply the entire market at a lower cost than two or more firms.
    - Natural monopolies: industries with high fixed costs and low marginal costs.

### Market Power

**Market power**: the ability of a firm to raise its price without losing all its customers.

- A perfectly competitive firm is a price taker. It has no market power.
- A monopoly is a price maker. It has market power.

For a monopoly, $MR < P$. This is because selling one more unit of a good requires lowering the price of all units sold.

Compared to a perfectly competitive market:

$Q_{mono} < Q_{comp}$, $P_{mono} > P_{comp}$

Determinants of market power:

$\frac{P-MC}{P} = \frac{1}{\varepsilon}$

where $\varepsilon = \frac{\Delta Q}{Q} / \frac{\Delta P}{P}$ is the price elasticity of demand.

- A monopolist market is protected by **no new entrants**.
- But the market power is limited by **elasticity of demand**.

Math behind the formula:

- $\varepsilon = \frac{\Delta Q}{Q} / \frac{\Delta P}{P}$
- $TR = P \times Q$
- $\Delta TR = P \times \Delta Q + Q \times \Delta P$
- $MR = \frac{\Delta TR}{\Delta Q} = P + \frac{Q \times \Delta P}{\Delta Q} = P (1 + \frac{Q}{\Delta Q}\frac{\Delta P}{P}) = P (1 + \frac{1}{\varepsilon})$
- $MR = MC \Rightarrow P (1 + \frac{1}{\varepsilon}) = MC \Rightarrow \frac{P-MC}{P} = \frac{1}{\varepsilon}$

### Allocative Efficiency

- A monopoly is allocatively inefficient because $P = MB > MC = MR$.
- Deadweight social loss is created.
- Part of the consumer surplus is transferred to the producer surplus.

**Price discrimination**: charging different prices to different customers for the same good.

- Perfect price discrimination: the monopolist charges each customer the maximum price they are willing to pay.
    - No consumer surplus, all surplus is captured by the producer. No deadweight loss.
- Imperfect price discrimination: the monopolist charges different prices to different groups of customers.

## 10. Monopolistic Competition

**Monopolistic competition**: a market structure in which many firms sell products that are similar but not identical.

### Profit Maximization

Short run profit $\pi = TR - TC$ is maximized when $MR = MC$.

Long run economic profit is zero. Firms enter the market when economic profit is positive. When $P = ATC$, economic profit is zero.

This is because new entrants decrease the quantity demanded facing a monopolistic competitive firm, causing the demand curve to shift left.

In perfect competition, zero economic profit is achieved because new entrants increase the quantity supplied and thus lower the price.

In monopolistic competition, elasticity of demand $\varepsilon > 1$, so the demand curve is elastic. This is because the demand is also elastic to the products of other firms.

- A monopolistic is closer to perfect competition than a monopoly.
- A monopolistic is allocatively inefficient because $P > MC$. Deadweight loss is created due to underproduction. However, this is offset by the product differentiation.

## 11. Oligopoly

### Cartel

Assume two firms A and B. If A lowers the price, B will also lower the price to compete. This is a **price war**. The price war will continue until the price is equal to the marginal cost $MR = MC$.

To avoid a price war, a few oligopoly firms can cooperate and form a **cartel**.

Companies in a cartel set the same price and share the market. The cartel behaves like a monopoly, in terms of price and quantity.

- When $MC = MR, P = P_0, Q = Q_c$, the cartel maximizes profit.
- The cartel profit $(P_0-ATC) \times Q_c$ may not be equally distributed among firms.

**Failure of Cartel**

- **Internal** failure: each firm has an incentive to cheat. If one firm increases output, it can sell more at the same price.
- **External** failure: new firms can enter the market and break the cartel.

### Game Theory

- **Nash Equilibrium**: The outcome that occurs when both players choose their best strategy, given the strategy of the other player.
    - Player A chooses the best strategy given the strategy of player B.
    - Player B chooses the best strategy given the strategy of player A.
- **Dominant Strategy**: A strategy that is the best choice for a player, regardless of the strategy chosen by the other player.
    - Player A chooses the best strategy regardless of the strategy of player B.
    - If both A and B choose their dominant strategy, the outcome is a **Dominant Strategy Equilibrium**.
    - **Dominant Strategy Equilibrium MUST BE a Nash Equilibrium**.
    - **Nash Equilibrium MAY NOT BE a Dominant Strategy Equilibrium**.
- **Prisoner's Dilemma**: A game in which players have a dominant strategy that leads to a worse outcome for both players.
    - Prisoner's Dilemma involves a Dominant Strategy Equilibrium that is not Pareto efficient.

**4-firm concentration ratio**: the percentage of total industry sales accounted for by the 4 largest firms.

In Monopoly, the 4-firm concentration ratio is 100%.

In Oligopoly, the 4-firm concentration ratio is high, but less than 100%.

In Perfect Comp and Mono Comp, the 4-firm concentration ratio is low.
