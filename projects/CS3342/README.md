The report template is based on [Penetration Testing Report Template](https://github.com/cyber-cfreg/Penetration-Test-Report-Template) by University of New Haven Cyber Forensics Research & Education Group.

The report is created with the help of [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/), a collaborative, cloud-based LaTeX editor used for writing, editing, and publishing scientific documents.
