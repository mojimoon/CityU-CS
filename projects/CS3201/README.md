# CS3201 Computer Networks Project

In this project, you are required to implement a simple bulletin board system (BBS) client.

The source code of server (in Python) is provided as part of the project description.

The client can be written in any programming language.

## Details

- The server runs on `localhost` port `16011`.
- You can test the server-client connection by
    - directly running the server and client on the same machine, or
    - connecting two machines in the same network, and enter the server's private IP address in the client, or
    - using a virtual machine to achieve the same effect as the previous method.
- For instructions on establishing a connection, please read [Programming Assignment.pdf](./Programming%20Assignment.pdf).
- Tested on Python 3.10.10 on Windows 11.
- Note: In `2023_3201_server_final.py`, **the server downloads the file to a hard-coded path `D:\`**. If you are using a Mac or Linux machine, please change the path to a valid path on your machine.
