# CS2115 Computer Organization Project

In this project, you are required to implement a simple 16-bit processor in Logisim.

## Details

- RISC architecture is used.
- All data, instructions and addresses are 16-bit.
- The processor has 8 general-purpose registers (R0 - R7), and a separate return address (RA) register.
- For the supported instructions, please read [HW-4-question.pdf](./HW-4-question.pdf).
- For the format of the instructions, please read [HW-4-answersheet.pdf](./HW-4-answersheet.pdf).
- To use the instruction memory files, choose the ROM `InstructionMemory` in Logisim, edit the content and choose `Open...` to load the file.
- Tested on Logisim-evolution v3.6.1 on Windows 11.
